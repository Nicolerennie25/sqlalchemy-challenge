# sqlalchemy-challenge
Module 10 challenge
# Overview:

This repository contains the completed SQLAlchemy Challenge, which involves analyzing and exploring climate data from a SQLite database using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Additionally, a Flask API is designed based on the analysis queries to provide access to the data through various endpoints.

# Project Structure:

SurfsUp/: Directory containing the main scripts and resources for the analysis.
climate_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for the climate analysis.
app.py: Python script implementing the Flask API.
Resources/: Folder containing the data files used for the analysis.
hawaii.sqlite: SQLite database file containing the climate data.
Analysis:

# The analysis is divided into two main parts:

# Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data:

Precipitation Analysis:
Retrieve the most recent date in the dataset.
Query the previous 12 months of precipitation data.
Plot the precipitation data and print summary statistics.
Station Analysis:
Calculate the total number of stations.
Identify the most-active stations and their observation counts.
Calculate the lowest, highest, and average temperatures for the most-active station.
Query the previous 12 months of temperature observation (TOBS) data for the most-active station and plot the results as a histogram.

# Part 2: Design Your Climate App:

Design a Flask API based on the analysis queries to provide access to the data through various endpoints.
Implement routes for:
Listing all available routes.
Retrieving precipitation data in JSON format.
Retrieving station data in JSON format.
Retrieving temperature observation data for the most-active station in JSON format.
Calculating temperature statistics for a specified start or start-end range and returning the results in JSON format.
